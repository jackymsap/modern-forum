# Modern Forum
Modern Forum is open-source message board software similar to [phpBB](http://www.phpbb.com) and [vBulletin](https://www.vbulletin.com) but built on [Apache CouchDB](https://couchdb.apache.org) using [CouchApp](http://couchapp.org) and JavaScript, instead of PHP and MySQL. Modern Forum is also built on the desire to completely renovate the traditional forum model and bring it into the new age.

### Core Tenets
- Speed.
- Asynchronous loading.
- Easily replicable.
- Lightweight.
- Easily theme-able.
- Real-time or as near real-time as possible.
- Touch optimized by default.

### What's Working Now
Much of the features detailed in version 0.5 of the [Roadmap](https://github.com/andrewrabon/modern-forum/wiki/Roadmap) are working right now, and in fact things are ahead of schedule. 0.5 may still release on May 22 but it's shaping up to be earlier than that. If it releases early, I don't think it will affect the other milestone's release dates.

You can see the live prototype version I'm working against [here](http://andrex.couchone.com/modern-forum/_design/modern-forum/index.html).

### What Still Has to Be Done
Please see the [Roadmap](https://github.com/andrewrabon/modern-forum/wiki/Roadmap) on our [wiki](https://github.com/andrewrabon/modern-forum/wiki) and check out the [open issues](https://github.com/andrewrabon/modern-forum/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=open&page=1) to see where Modern Forum is headed.

### Thanks!
Thank you for your interest in this project. There's not much here now but I'm very excited 
at the possibility of a CouchApp message board.
