# Modern Forum
Modern Forum is message board software similar to phpBB and vBulletin but built on CouchDB, 
and also built on the desire to completely renovate the traditional forum model and bring 
it into the new age.

## Core Tenets
- Speed.
- Asynchronous loading.
- Easily replicable.
- Lightweight.
- Easily theme-able.
- Real-time or as near real-time as possible.
- Touch optimized by default.

## What's Working Now
Not a whole lot, to be honest. What's here is basically what's been sitting on my computer 
since I started the project last January. I figured the biggest kick in the pants to get 
the ball rolling again would be to push it to GitHub and see if anyone was interested in 
the project. Then again, I also want to improve the code I wrote since it's now public, 
too.

All that said, the following pieces work:

- Loading the default template.
- Loading users from the database.
- Loading threads from the database.
- Loading posts from the database.

You can see the live prototype version I'm working against [here](http://andrex.couchone.com/modern-forum/_design/modern-forum/index.html).

## What Still Has to Be Done
Please see the [Roadmap](https://github.com/andrewrabon/modern-forum/wiki/Roadmap) on our [wiki](https://github.com/andrewrabon/modern-forum/wiki)
and check out the [open issues](https://github.com/andrewrabon/modern-forum/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=open&page=1) to see where Modern Forum is headed.

## Thanks!
Thank you for your interest in this project. There's not much here now but I'm very excited 
at the possibility of a CouchApp message board.
