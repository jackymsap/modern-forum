# Modern Forum
Modern Forum is message board software similar to phpBB and vBulletin but built on CouchDB, 
and also built on the desire to completely renovate the traditional forum model and bring 
it into the new age.

# Core Tenets
- Speed.
- Asynchronous loading.
- Easily replicable.
- Lightweight.
- Easily theme-able.
- Real-time or as near real-time as possible.
- Touch optimized by default.

# What's Working Now
Not a whole lot, to be honest. What's here is basically what's been sitting on my computer 
since I started the project last January. I figured the biggest kick in the pants to get 
the ball rolling again would be to push it to GitHub and see if anyone was interested in 
the project. Then again, I also want to improve the code I wrote since it's now public, 
too.

All that said, the following pieces work:

- Loading the default template.
- Loading users from the database.
- Loading threads from the database.
- Loading posts from the database.

# What Still Has to Be Done
This list is for what must be done before I would consider Modern Forum at the 1.0 level.

- User registration and logging in.
- Thread creation.
- Post creation.
- User settings like avatar, timezone, etc.
- Basic suspend/ban/spam functionality.

# Way Future Stuff
This is the post-1.0 stuff I'm keeping in mind while I sort out the architecture

- Real-time thread notification updates.
- Admin console.
- Advanced options.
- OAuth login capability.
- Private messaging and PM boxes.
- Advanced templating functionality.

# Thanks!
Thank you for your interest in this project. There's not much here now but I'm very excited 
at the possibility of a CouchApp message board.
